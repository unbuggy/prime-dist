# NAME
#   sample - calls `main`, passing width and height according to terminal size
#
# SYNOPSYS
#   sample <size>
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   This script calls the `main` program (see `src/main.cpp`) to print a
#   histogram of prime number distribution across ranges of a specified `size`.
#   The script passes width and height parameters to `main` according to the
#   current terminal size as determined by `tput(1)`.
#
# SEE ALSO
#   * src/main.cpp for the `main` program definition
